# YAMCS Plugin for Open MCT
This project provides a plugin for connecting Open MCT to a YAMCS backend.

## Installation
```
npm install --save akhenry/openmct-yamcs
```
TODO: How to use the package from your code?

## Configuration

# Example

An example is provided in this repository that can be configured to run against any YAMCS installation. This is designed to get you up and running quickly, and should work with no configuration changes if you are running the "My Project" example on `http://localhost:8090/`.

## Prerequisites
* The YAMCS Quickstart example is assumed to have been installed and to be running successfully. See https://github.com/yamcs/quickstart

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/akhenry/openmct-yamcs.git
cd openmct-yamcs
npm install
npm start
```

This should build the example, and launch a web browser with Open MCT connected to your locally running YAMCS server.
